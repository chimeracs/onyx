Requirements:

- Have the blue dots

Instructions:
1) Go to chrome://extensions.
2) Go to "Keyboard shortcuts".
3) Find the "uBlock Origin Lite" extension.
4) Bind the "create a custom filter" to a keybind of your choice. (ex: control + search + q)
5) Now, open several tabs / proxies and do whatever you want. When the blue dots appear, press (your keybind combination) and select the blue dots.
   Click the "+" button and add it.
6) Profit! When you visit websites now, the overlay should not appear and you can do whatever you want without the annoying blue dots.
