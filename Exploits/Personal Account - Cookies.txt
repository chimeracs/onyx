Add personal Gmail/google accounts to your school chromebook if it is blocked. This adds the account to Google Chrome and not the actual device.

Prerequisites: 
- Being able to mess with cookies from websites

1. Go to https://google.com/
2. Go to the 2 lines next to the URL. Click it and then click "Cookies and site data". Now, click on "Manage on site data".
3. Below the "Data on the site you're viewing", make sure to go through all the domains listed and "Dont allow to save data".
4. When you do that for all the domains listed, click the bright blue "Done" button. Afterwards, refresh the page.
5. After the page you're currently on reloads, click on the "Sign in" button at the top right corner. 
   Sometimes, it will just reload the page and do nothing so just skip straight to the bottom for the slightly different route.  If it does not reload, continue.
6. Then, sign in with either your school email or personal Gmail and it should give you an error that "Cookies are disabled". 
7. Now, click the 2 lines for that page -> cookies and site data -> manage on site data.
8. For this, you need to go to the "account.google.com" domain and click on the 3 dots and allow it. 
   This time, press the left arrow at the top left of the screen and try logging in again. You should now be able to sign without issues. 
9. Now, you are mostly done. However, this method can make a bunch of google sites not work (like google classroom, google docs, Gmail). 
   The way to fix this is the same way with the account.google.com.
10. Go to each of the google websites, and allow to save date for the domain of the website you're on only (ex classroom.google.com, mail.google.com, docs.google.com).
    This will make them work again.

For the slightly different approach:
Go to gmail.com instead, it will give an error. Now, allow the cookies for that domain only (mail.google.com)
Switch account to add, click the blue highlighted part when it loads, and continue with the instructions above.
